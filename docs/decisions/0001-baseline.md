# 0001 — Baseline: no lint/type/test toolchain

Date: 2026-09-28
Status: accepted

## Context
At the moment the agent harness was installed, the project had **no**
automated quality tooling: no test framework, no linter, no type checker,
no formatter, and no CI. It is a static site (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) plus a
small offline Python/ffmpeg image pipeline.

Adding a real toolchain (eslint, ruff, mypy, a test runner) would mean
installing dependencies and could flag a large amount of existing code.
The project owner explicitly asked not to mass-fix the current code.

## Decision
`scripts/check.sh` only checks what requires no new dependency:
- `features.json` is valid JSON,
- JS parses (`node --check`),
- Python tools parse (`python3 -m py_compile`, which does not import the deps),
- shell scripts parse (`bash -n`).

**Baseline**: the existing code is accepted as-is. Any *new* code must pass
`./scripts/check.sh`. Introducing eslint/ruff/mypy/tests is a separate,
explicit decision to be made later.

## Consequences
- The check is weak by design: it cannot catch logic bugs, style or dead code.
- An agent must NOT weaken `check.sh` or add `disable` comments to go green.
- If a real toolchain is added later, do it as its own feature, run it once to
  record the existing violations, and only then make it blocking.
